        <p>An average family in the west throws away around 20-40 kgs of food packaging waste every month.</p>
        <p>It takes 5,000 litres of water to make 1kg of cheese, 20,000 litres to grow 1kg of coffee, and 100,000 litres
          to produce 1kg of hamburger beef.</p>
        <p>The food industry annually spends over £10.5 billion on chemicals to add to food and alter it.</p>
        <p>A third of all fruit and vegetables we eat contain pesticide residues</p>
        <p>Avocados contain a special kind of sugar that helps prevent low blood sugar, so may be the ideal diet food.

      <h2 class="d-intro">Why Eat Organic?</h2>
      <div class="fact-grid">
        <p>For <b>Health</b> - On average, organic fruit and vegetables contain higher levels of vitamin C, essential
          minerals and cancer-fighting antioxidants.</p>
        <p>No <b>Nasty Additives</b> - Amongst the many additives banned by the Soil Association are hydrogenated fat,
          aspartame (artificial sweetener) and monosodium glutamate (MSG).</p>
        <p>Avoids <b>Pesticides</b> - Over 400 chemical pesticides are rountinely used in conventional farming.
          Pesticides are often present in non-organic food.</p>
        <p>Care for <b>Animals</b> - No system of farming has higher levels of animal welfare standards than organic
          farms working to Soil Association standards.</p>
        <p>Good for <b>Wildlife</b> and the <b>Environment</b> - Organic farming is better for wildlife, causes lower
          pollution from sprays and produces less carbon dioxide - the main global warming gas.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="organic-blurb">
        <p>"Food is steeped in oil. About 400 gallons of diesel are needed to produce the average American's food
          annually, and a similar figure holds here. Most of our food is produced using nitrogen fertiliser, the 'wonder
          chemical' enabling non-organic farmers to maximise the productivity of their fields. But such chemical
          fertility doesn't come free. Each one tonne of fertiliser takes one tonne of oil and 108 tonnes of water to
          make, giving off seven tonnes of carbon dioxide in the process. If farming is to become climate-friendly, it
          must rely less on fossil fuels. That means fewer chemical fertilisers, more use of rotations and natural
          fertility-buliding crops like clover"</p>

      <h2 class="d-intro">Organic or not Organic:</h2>
      <div class="organic-blurb">
        <ul>
          <li>It is important to remember that all fruits, should be sub ripened and grown organically. The same rule
            should be applied for vegetables, grains and the way farm animals are raised.</li>
          <li>The sooner the produce is utilized after harvest, the more alive and nutritious it is. Therefore, sprouts
            and grasses, which can be grown all year round in any climate and homes, are so beneficial.</li>
          <li>Good food is dependent upon healthy soil. Just as certain bacteria in our intestines are necessary for the
            proper digestion and assimilation of food, so plants need certain bacteria to enable them to flourish.</li>
          <li>Soil that is extensively treated with chemicals becomes so depleted of enzymes and nutrients, that the
            resulting produce lacks vitamins and minerals, which is then often compensated for by more chemical
            injection. Unfortunately, the conventional method of growing produce today is dependent upon chemicals: to
            fertilize the soil, to control pests and diseases, to enhance growth and appearance and to prolong the
            shelf-life of produce.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately, every chemical that has been used on plants or animals will be there when we eat it, and
            they can’t be washed away with water. Plants and animals, like us, absorb everything that has been given to
            or used on them during their lifetime. More disturbing is the fact that our body must cope with the toxic
            residues that becomes part of our food. </li>
          <li>These types of toxins are not easily eliminated by our gastrointestinal systems. They build up over time
            and attack our immune system, leaving us susceptible to allergies, diseases and degeneration. Today, more
            and more people need to take vitamin and mineral supplements in order to replace what is not present in the
            food we eat, so called ‘empty food’.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="d-intro">The Alphabet of Food Additives:</h2>
      <div class="additives-blurb">
        <ol>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">A</span>cidity regulators</b>, used to alter and control the acidity or
            alkalinity levels for different desired effects, which can include preservation, added/altered tartness,
            colour retention and to assist raising agents.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">A</span>cids</b>, used to control to what degree other substances function
            and/or to impart a sharp taste. Assists in the release of carbon dioxide in raising agents and can have a
            preservative effect.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">A</span>nti-caking agents</b>, used to ensure the free flow in products such
            as dried milks, icing sugar and table salt.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">A</span>nti-foaming agents</b>, used to reduce or prevent foaming (frothing)
            on boiling and to reduce scum forming.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">A</span>ntioxidants</b>, used to protect food against deterioration caused by
            exposure to air (oxidation), such as fat rancidity, flavour deterioration or colour changes.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">B</span>leaching agents</b>, used to artificially whiten flour.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">B</span>uffers</b>, see acidity regulators.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">B</span>ulking agents</b>, used to increase volume without significantly
            adding to the energy levels of the food. Normally used in diet foods but can also be used to pad out
            expensive ingredients. Not usually digested and acts as a source of dietary fiber (roughage).</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">C</span>arriers and carrier solvents</b>, used to modify a food additive (by
            dissolving, diluting or dispersing etc.), without changing its function, to enable easier use or handling.
          </li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">C</span>olours</b>, used to restore or reinforce colour lost during
            processing or storage, to give colour to foods which otherwise would be virtually colourless (such as soft
            drinks) and to ensure uniformity from batch to batch.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">E</span>mulsifiers</b>, used to aid in the formation and maintenance of the
            dispersion of two or more substances, which would normally separate and not normally mix, such as oil and
            water. Milk, mayonnaise and salad dressings are typical oil in water emulsions, butter and margarine water
            in oil emulsions.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">E</span>mulsifying salts</b>, used to disperse protein so reducing the
            stringiness in cooked cheese.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">F</span>irming agents</b>, used to make or retain firmness or crispness in
            fruit and vegetables and to strengthen gels.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">F</span>lavour enhancers</b>, used to enhance or bring out the flavour and/or
            odours in foods without imparting a distinctive flavour of their own.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">F</span>lavours</b>, there are around 4,000 flavours and they are used for
            the same reasons for flavour as colourings are for colour, to restore, reinforce, add what is not there and
            to ensure batch uniformity. They are not presently subject to the 'E Number' system nor are they required to
            be separately shown on food labels. About labels and flavour, note that 'xx flavour' means just what it
            says, the product does not need to contain any xx, just taste as though it does. However, 'xx flavoured' on
            the label means that the product must contain xx. The 'ed' makes all the difference.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">F</span>lour improvers</b>, used to enhance the elastic properties and aid
            the development of dough. Also accelerates the effect of bleaching agents.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">F</span>oaming agents</b>, used to provide a uniform dispersion of gas in a
            food.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">G</span>elling agents</b>, used to form a jelly to provide texture to a
            product.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">G</span>lazing agents</b>, used to produce a protective coating or to impart
            a polish/sheen on the surface of a food such as confectionery or citrus fruit.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">H</span>umectants</b>, used to retain moisture in foods by absorbing water
            from the air to prevent drying out.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">M</span>odified starch</b>, used for various functions including adding
            texture, adding bulk, stabilizing and as a thickener.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">P</span>ackaging gases</b>, used to replace air in the packaging of
            foodstuffs susceptible to oxidation Not necessarily shown on food labels.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">P</span>reservatives</b>, used to extend the shelf life of products by
            preventing the growth of micro-organisms, which could otherwise cause food decay and, in some cases, food
            poisoning.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">P</span>ropellants</b>, a gas or volatile liquid used to expel foodstuffs
            from aerosols.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">R</span>aising agents</b>, used to increase the volume of doughs and batters
            by promoting gas release (aeration).</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">R</span>eleasing agents</b>, used to prevent foodstuffs sticking to
            machinery, molds, packaging etc. but not necessarily shown on food labels even though some may remain in the
            food.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">S</span>equestrants</b>, used to combine with trace metals in the environment
            to render them inactive.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">S</span>tabilisers</b>, used to maintain the physical state of a food and to
            stabilize, retain or intensify the existing colour of a food, particularly emulsions, and therefore often
            used with emulsifiers. </li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">S</span>weeteners:</b></li>
          <li>Intense sweeteners: they have a sweetness many times that of sugar and are therefore used at very low
            levels. They are used in products such as diet foods, soft drinks and tabletop sweeteners.</li>
          <li>Bulk sweeteners: they have a similar sweetness to sugar and are used at comparable levels. Unlike intense
            sweeteners they also provide bulk (although their main function is to provide sweetness). They are used in
            products such as sugar-free confectionery and foods for diabetics.</li>
          <li><b><span class="add-capital">T</span>hickeners</b>, used to increase viscosity, modify texture and impart
            stability.</li>
