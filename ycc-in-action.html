          <p>"Bosco is an engaging and charismatic speaker with an important message about public health and
            environmental sustainability in Scotland: we need to cultivate a closer relationship with food. This is
            central to Bosco’s mission to empower the next generation to grow food locally, to develop culinary
            knowledge and skills, and to foster a closer connection with people and planet".</p>

          <p>"My kids love YOU CAN COOK and You Can Grow! They’ve enjoyed watching the edible garden grow at their
            school and then learning how to cook with fresh produce. Bosco and his team are always full of fun energy

            and enthusiasm in promoting health and wellbeing, community spirit and, above all else, cracking good food!
            Wonderful seeing young people gain skills and experience growing then cooking food they have produced at You

          <p>"Attended a YOU CAN COOK session in St. Boswells Village Hall last year. Crammed with information, fun, a
            chance to get your sleeves rolled up and get involved with loads of recipe ideas to take away, everyone who
            came along was bowled over by the energy and enthusiasm of the session. Would highly recommend the

          <p>"Financial Inclusion Project Borders would like to thank the YOU CAN COOK team for delivering the series of
            ‘Cooking on a Budget’ workshops for us throughout the Borders over the past three months. The feedback from
            those attending the workshops has been excellent."</p>
          <h6>From Sandy Brydon, Financial Inclusion Project Borders</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"I became aware of YOU CAN COOK through Alex Wilson who ran the Edible Garden at my local primary school.
            In my late 40's, I guess that I was surprised to find that there was still lots for me to learn about
            growing my own food. Alex and the team helped me to appreciate how I used my garden and helped me to build
            vegetable beds. I now have five and do my best to plan annual rotations. From time to time, I still visit
            the garden that's now being run by another Alex (Smithson) and I am grateful that it still plays a huge part
            in our community. As well as her continued work with the children from the primary school, Alex has also got
            the children to help me with the planting of the town's flower beds. The 'Edible Garden' project as it's now
            called, is amazing and has become an integrated part of the community in Innerleithen."</p>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"They visited Kingsland Primary School a few years ago and my daughter was very fortunate to be one of a
            small group of children picked to do a course of cooking, she loved it and is now a better cook than me and
            still cooks the recipes she learned back then to this day. Bosco, you and your team are amazing you make
            food and cooking so enjoyable for children"</p>

          <p>"On behalf of 2nd Peebles Guides, I would like to thank YOU CAN COOK for the second round of cooking
            classes they have run with our girls. All of the girls really enjoyed cooking with Evelyn and have taken
            recipes home and some have recreated the food they made at guides. Well done YOU CAN COOK, you have clearly
            made a great impression on the girls!"</p>
          <h6>From Hannah Moss, 2nd Peebles Guides</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"Spectrum Support have been working with YOU CAN COOK since last May and it has been a truly brilliant
            experience! Our class has attended weekly sessions in the Community Garden project that involve planting,
            picking, building and general maintenance of the garden. The staff have all been wonderful with the pupils
            differentiating the activities for our pupils and facilitating an enthusiasm for gardening. These sessions
            have been extremely meaningful for the pupils and over the time, they have all really enjoyed seeing the end
            products of their hard work. The potato dig was like digging for treasure! Most of the pupils in the class
            have now also transferred their skills and enthusiasm to home, helping parents in their own garden. A
            wonderful learning experience for both pupils and staff!"</p>

        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"The family Support service have worked with YOU CAN COOK to provide a cooking group for some of our
            service users.
            The group has been very successful with the participants enjoying the combination of improving their cooking
            skills, learning more about food and nutrition and the social aspect of eating together and enjoying healthy
            home cooked food.
            The staff are all knowledgeable and have introduced some new ideas to the group that have been embraced by
            them.
            We as a service have been delighted to work with such an exciting and vibrant organisation."</p>
          <h6>From Kirsten Jonassen, Support Worker, Scottish Borders Council</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"I wanted to pass on my thanks to Bosco and Aiveen from YOU CAN COOK for running several successful cooking
            sessions with my Scouts from Peebles Scout Group. Cooking activities are always popular with our young
            people but having a professional supervise a cooking session,showing just how easy it is to create great
            food from simple ingredients, was a real bonus in our teaching process.It complimented the Scout leaders'
            sessions very well as it focused on the normal kitchen environment, something which for us is normally
            difficult to recreate.
            Aiveen also passed on really helpful information to the young people about the ingredients in the tasty
            recipes and why they are so good to use. When a new set of Scouts comes along we'd love to have them back
            again."</p>
          <h6>From John McCusker, Scout Leader, Peebles Scout Group</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"Just wanted to say thank you so much for the lessons you were able to organise for our guides last month.
            They all had a fantastic time and I'm already hearing reports from parents about them cooking at home!
            Evelina and Mona were both so good with them and had endless patience - much more than they get from me!!"
          </p>
          <h6>From Kate Rowell, Girl Guides Organiser, Peebles</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"All of the young people who took part in the workshops thoroughly enjoyed the YOU CAN COOK experience with
            Alex who very quickly established an excellent rapport with the young people - indeed we are sad to see her
            go! Over the course of the 5 week cooking workshops we have seen more and more of the young people show
            interest and participate. All of the young people learned new ways to cook familiar foods as well as trying
            experiments with new tastes. Alex also demonstrated that key recipes are transferable to lots of different
            dishes hence keeping costs down and proving to the young people that you can eat healthily on a budget! For
            some of the young people it has been about learning key life skills which will undoubtedly help them survive
            at home and for others the skills and knowledge gained now will prove beneficial if they progress in later
            years to further or higher education and have to live independently. The input from YOU CAN COOK has been an
            invaluable experience for the young people who attend Innerleithen Area Youth Group and it engaged
            participants from Peebles, Eddleston, Walkerburn, Cardrona as well as Innerleithen and Traquair. It has
            undoubtedly engaged young people and we would love to take part in any future workshops that YOU CAN COOK
            can offer."</p>
          <h6>From Susan C Moncur, Youth Worker, Innerleithen Youth Group</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"We joined forces with YOU CAN COOK to deliver a series of healthy cookery workshops to help migrants
            integrate into the Scottish Borders. The focus was on seasonal Scottish produce, easy and quick recipes. The
            class was a mix of migrant workers and locals who had great fun and helped in the integration process."</p>
          <h6>From Lukasz Bogus, Development Worker, Eildon Housing Association</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"Bosco and his team bring a variety of experience to a project, engaging participants and making the whole
            process not only a learning experience but also very importantly fun. Their ability to engage such a wide
            range of attendees was a key to the success of our course."</p>

          <p>"Thank you very much for sending Douglas to work with our children they had a super time and his workshops

        <div class="indi-testimonial">
          <p>"Can you please pass on a big thank you to Alex for the fantastic demo she did for the pupils yesterday.
            They all were keen to get involved and really enjoyed not only the cooking but the tasting as well! The dish
            they helped prepare was well received and enjoyed by all. The kids were a great bunch and we have some great
            photos of them joining in, great fun and thoroughly enjoyable. Thanks again!!"</p>

          <p>"We had an excellent interactive session with easy to do and adaptable recipes with great scope for all
            sorts of leftovers to be incorporated and gave people a lot of ideas and inspiration. The information that
            was given about nutrition, environmental care and safety was well balanced and the actual food cooked was
            DELICIOUS!!! Everybody who attended really enjoyed it and I would highly recommend this session to other
