# YOU-CAN-COOK-Redesign
 
I was given a brief to overhaul the company's website which hadn't changed since the late 2000s. 
I was given a fair amount of flexibility when it came to the design, but I still had to ensure it was reflective of the company values. Some of the key phrases thrown around during the early stages of design were “vibrant”, “colourful” & “unique”.

On the whole, the site uses very little Javascript, apart from snippets for a mobile menu, “top of the page” button and miscellaneous visual tweaks for added style. 

The site was designed to be static initially as the client wasn’t expecting regular updates to be added. However, over time, I integrated Wordpress functionality to allow the client to self-post blogs and provided further improvements on the backend to clean up my initial code base.
