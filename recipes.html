                  <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
                  <li>2 sliced onions</li>
                  <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
                  <li>30g of spinach</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Cook the bacon in a large pot over a medium-high heat until crispy.</p>
                <p>Add chicken and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then cook until the meat doesn’t show any
                  more pinkness and subsequently remove it from the pot.</p>
                <p> Once the onions have been caramelised, add the spinach and cook until wilted.</p>
                <p>Add milk and bring to the boil.</p>
                <p>Add the fettuccine to the boiling mixture and cover.</p>
                <p>Cook the fettuccine on a medium heat until the milk has thickened and the pasta has been cooked
                  (about 7 minutes).</p>
                <p>Mix it back into the chicken and then stir in the pesto and parmesan.</p>
                <p>Garnish with parsley and additional Parmesan, then serve.</p>

                <p>Add stock and lentils to the pan and bring it to the boil.</p>
                <p> Use a whisk to stir the lentil soup as it will help break up the lentils and help with the
                  consistency of the soup. Finally, cook for 35-40 minutes on a medium heat.</p>

                  <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
                  <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
                  <li>2 sliced onions</li>
                  <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
                  <li>140g of spinach</li>
                  <li>5 cups of milk</li>
                  <li>450g of fettuccine</li>

                  <li>1 cup of Parmesan</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>In a large pot over a medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Then add the chicken and season
                  with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook until no pink is showing, then remove the chicken.</p>
                <p>Add the onions and garlic and cook until softened. Once the onions have been caramelized, add the
                  spinach and cook until wilted.</p>
                <p>Add milk and bring to boil. Add the fettuccine and cover the pot.</p>
                <p> Cook the fettuccine on medium heat until the milk thickens and the pasta is cooked (that will take
                  about 7 minutes)</p>
                <p>Mix it back in with the chicken, then stir in the pesto and Parmesan. Garnish with parsley and
                  additional Parmesan.</p>

                  <li>1 teaspoon of honey</li>
                  <li>1 garlic clove (crushed)</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons of lemon juice or white wine vinegar</li>
                  <li>6 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees celsius.</p>
                <p>Lay a stretch of cling film on a chopping board. Put one of the chicken breasts on top, and then
                  cover it with another layer of cling film. Bash the meat with a rolling pin to flatten and tenderise
                  it.</p>
                <p>Cut the chicken laterally across to create a pocket in the side, then season with salt and pepper,
                  and add the crushed garlic clove. Put in a slice of ham, the slices of mozzarella/fontina and the
                  basil. Press the edges of the chicken well together to seal. Then repeat with the other chicken breast
                </p>
                <p>Beat the eggs and leave in a wide bowl. Spread some breadcrumbs/semolina/polenta on another plate.
                  Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan.</p>
                <p>Dip the whole of each fillet into the seasoned flour, then the beaten eggs. Finish it off by covering
                  them with breadcrumbs/semolina or polenta. Fry for a few minutes on each side to seal.</p>
                <p>Bake on a greased baking tray for 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked through. Test with a sharp
                  knife to check that the meat is white and moist.</p>
                <p><b>Tomato Sauce</b></p>
                <p>Heat the oil gently in a pan, add the finely chopped onion and allow it to soften over low heat for
                  5-8 minutes. As soon as the onion starts softening add the garlic, either crushed or finely chopped
                  and allow it to golden.</p>
                <p>At this point add a teaspoon of dry basil/oregano/thyme depending on which one you are using. Stir
                  fry for a few seconds to allow the herb’s aroma to infuse with the oil and add the chopped tomatoes
                  and a pinch of sugar. Season with some sea salt and pepper.</p>
                <p>Simmer very gently for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally. If it gets too thick, add a splash of
                  water. Adjust seasoning and add a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>
                <p><b>Mustard Dressing</b></p>
                <p>Mix all the ingredients together in a jar. Close with a lid and shake well before use. Keep in a jar
                  and store any excess dressing in the fridge.</p>
                <p><b>Spicy Salad</b></p>
                <p>Put all the salad leaves in a bowl and drizzle with the mustard dressing. Stir well.</p>
                <p>Serve the chicken with the salad and tomato sauce.</p>

                <p>Cut the chicken breast into 1cm thick strips. Pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks.

                <p>Drain under cold water, then drizzle a little oil over it and put it to one side. Toss the cashew
                  nuts with a tablespoon of water and icing sugar. Then drop them into a hot saucepan and cook, shaking

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius. Grease the tin or dish you wish to use.</p>
                <p>Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface until it’s 5mm or so thick, and then line the dish.
                  Grate the potato and place some in the bottom, on top of the pastry. This prevents the pastry from
                  getting soggy. Fill and cover the top with pastry.</p>
                <p><b>Leek and Haddock filling</b></p>
                <p>Cook the fish for 2 minutes in 445ml of milk. Strain and keep the milk for the white sauce. Melt
                  butter in a pan, add the chopped leeks and melt. Add 1 tablespoon of flour and stir to absorb the
                  butter.</p>
                <p>Add the milk gradually, and stir to thicken the flour. It needs to simmer for 5 minutes. Add the fish
                  and switch the heat off.</p>
                <p><b>Chicken and Mushroom filling</b></p>
                <p>Melt the onion in the butter till transparent (If you’re using uncooked chicken, add it to the onion
                  and seal). Add 1 tablespoon of plain flour and mix in the juices. Add 445ml of milk gradually and stir
                  to thicken. Simmer for 5 minutes to cook the flour. (If you’re using cooked chicken, add it now).</p>
                <p>Fill the pies and brush the top of the pastry with beaten eggs. Place the pies in the oven for 30-40
                  minutes. (Depends on individual oven temperatures).</p>

                  <li>450g of lamb’s liver (washed, trimmed and chopped)</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
                  <li>2 bunches of green onions</li>
                  <li>1/2 cup of long-grain white rice</li>
                  <li>2 cups of hot beef stock</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon of chopped fresh mint</li>
                  <li>2 large eggs (beaten)</li>
                  <li>1 cup of plain yoghurt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees celsius. Sauté the liver in butter, in a casserole dish. When it’s
                  nearly done, add the onions and sauté for a few minutes. Add rice and sauté, stirring well.</p>
                <p>Add the stock, salt and pepper to taste and mint. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>Remove the lid, combine the eggs with yoghurt to make the custard and spread it over the liver-rice
                  mixture. Place in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the custard is golden-brown.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius. Put a pan of water on to boil (salt the water if you wish),
                  and add the potatoes. Cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep pot, and fry the mince until it browns. Then add the chopped onion
                  and carrot, and cook for a further 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Add the water to the
                  pan and stir.</p>
                <p>Take the gravy powder and blend with a little water to form a very smooth paste. Remove the mince
                  mixture from the heat and add the gravy paste, stirring all the time. The mixture should thicken (if
                  it doesn’t, make up a little more paste). Pour the mixture into an ovenproof dish.</p>
                <p>When the potatoes are soft, drain them and mash them with the butter. Spread out over the top of the
                  mince mixture using a fork. Place in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the top is golden and crispy.

                  <li>300g of small/cherry tomatoes</li>
                  <li>A handful of fresh basil leaves or a tablespoon of dried basil</li>
                  <li>A sprig of fresh rosemary or a teaspoon of dried rosemary</li>

                  <li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Heat a splash of oil in a large, heavy frying pan. Place the chicken pieces in the pan and put the
                  lid on. Allow them to cook on a medium heat, turning them over as they brown, so they cook evenly.
                  Take your time, because if they cook too quickly, they will start to burn on the outside before they
                  cook through to the middle.</p>
                <p>Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, if you’re using small ordinary tomatoes, slice those in quarters.
                  When the chicken has been turned a couple of times and is starting to look brown, sprinkle the
                  rosemary into the pan, and proceed to stir it around the chicken pieces in order to coat them.
                  Continue to cook the chicken with the lid on.</p>
                <p>Peel and chop the onions into chunks about the same size as the tomato pieces. Check that the chicken
                  pieces are cooked by pushing down on one with the edge of a wooden spoon. It should break apart
                  without difficulty. When they’re cooked, tip them into an oven-proof dish.</p>
                <p>Scatter the tomatoes, chopped onions, basil and a little salt and pepper into the same dish. Then
                  sprinkle about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar over it all. Bake in the oven at 200 degrees celsius
                  for about 20 minutes. (You will know when the dish is ready as the onions and tomatoes will be hot and
                  soft).</p>

                  <li>100ml of water</li>
                  <li>6 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                  <li>2 onions</li>
                  <li>175g of chopped tomatoes</li>
                  <li>3/4 of a tub of yoghurt (add more for a milder curry)</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons of corn flour</li>
                  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Brown off the chicken in a pan with some oil, and then remove from the aforesaid pan. Gently fry off
                  the onions until soft.</p>
                <p>Puree the garlic, ginger and water to make a paste. Once the onions are soft, add the garlic and
                  ginger paste to it. Gently cook and reduce the paste so that the water evaporates almost completely.
                </p>
                <p>Once the paste has been reduced, add in all the spices (cumin, turmeric, ground coriander, cayenne
                  pepper, salt and pepper). Reduce the heat, and add the tomatoes and some chopped coriander stems.</p>
                <p>Add two tablespoons of corn flour to the pot at the same time as the yoghurt. Pour in the yoghurt
                  slowly to ensure that it doesn’t split. (If it starts to split, add some more corn flour). Add in the
                  chicken and heat through.</p>
                <p>Add some chopped coriander to garnish, and then serve.</p>

                  grated cheese (save a little for the top).</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Cut the fish into bite-sized pieces. Shred the ginger with a grater or chop it up finely. Peel the
                  potatoes if you wish and parboil them for 10 minutes.</p>
                <p>Cut the leeks lengthways into quarters (keep the green tops for a soup) and then cut across the leeks
                  every 1.2 cm. This helps them cook better and makes it easier to wash out the bits of soil which can
                  often become trapped between the layers. Wash them well in a sieve. Heat the oil in a large frying
                  pan, ideally one with a lid. Add the garlic, ginger, leeks and potatoes, and stir-fry over a high heat
                  for 3-4 minutes.</p>
                <p>Add the curry powder just before you reduce the heat to simmer gently for 5-6 minutes with the lid
                  on. Spread the fish gently over the surface cooking them for a couple of minutes on each side, turning
                  them with care. Dissolve the stock in a little boiling water and add it and the milk to the pan. Place
                  the tomatoes on the surface, and simmer for 5 minutes with the lid on.</p>
                <p>Serve with freshly squeezed lemon juice.</p>

                  <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
                  <li>Olive oil</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Put a pot full of water to boil while you start preparing the sauce. Cut the onion into small pieces
                  and fry in a little bit of olive oil. When it becomes soft and golden, add the tomatoes, a pinch of
                  sugar, salt and allow it to cook on a low-medium heat for as long as you can (at least 20-30 minutes),
                  keep stirring from time to time, and add water if the sauce begins to dry out.</p>
                <p>Drain the tuna and add it to the sauce, leaving it to simmer for another 5 minutes. Taste and add
                  more salt if needed. Now that the sauce is ready, add a good tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley, mix
                  well, turn off the gas and leave it covered until the pasta is ready. When the water boils, add some
                  salt and oil to it (the oil helps to keep the pasta from sticking), and finally pour the pasta into
                  the boiling water and mix well.</p>
                <p>Follow the cooking time on the packet, but still check by tasting whether or not it’s al dente. When
                  ready, drain the water, pour the pasta back into the pot, add the sauce and mix it together over a
                  medium heat for a few seconds. This allows the pasta time to absorb the flavours.</p>

                  frozen shrimps, first boil some water in a small pan, add the shrimp and leave it for a minute, to
                  allow the shrimps to defrost. Drain and keep them aside.</p>
                <p>In a frying pan, heat up the olive oil, together with the chopped garlic and sliced chilli for 1-2
                  minutes (don’t let it burn or else it will taste bitter). Add the shrimps and stir-fry for a few
                  minutes. Finally, add a good handful of finely chopped parsley and some soy sauce to finish. When the
                  rice is ready, drain well in a colander.</p>
                <p>Pour the cooked rice into the same pan where you have the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Ready
                  to eat, or store in a refrigerator. <b>Remember that rice must be reheated properly before
                    consuming.</b></p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Chop the onions and garlic finely and put them in a frying pan with a lid, to tick away slowly on low
                  heat in some olive oil for about 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Whilst the onions stew, grease a shallow baking tray and roll out the pastry on a bed of flour. Line
                  the baking tray with the pastry base and turn up the edges. Paint the edges with a little olive oil.
                  Once the onions have collapsed into a mush, spread them evenly over the surface of the pastry.</p>
                <p>Make a nice pattern with the anchovies/fish and olives if you have some, and sprinkle the herbs (and
                  possibly Parmesan, if you have it) over it. Bake in the oven at 220 degrees celsius for 15 minutes, or
                  until the pastry is crisp and golden brown.</p>
                <p><i>For a vegetarian version with a mild flavour just use the onions and garlic with some fresh
                    rosemary sprinkled over the top. You can also make a focaccia based version of this with the onion
                    and rosemary topping, sprinkled with coarse salt and some olives if you have them.</i></p>

                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>700g of strong white bread flour (which should be warmed for about 10 minutes in the oven at its
                    lowest setting)</li>
                  <li>One tablespoon of salt</li>
                  <li>One tablespoon of easy-blend dried yeast</li>
                  <li>One tablespoon of caster sugar</li>
                  <li>425ml of hot water</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Sift the flour into a bowl with one tablespoon of salt, dried yeast and caster sugar. Make a well in
                  the centre and add enough hot water to make a soft dough – you will need about 425ml of it. Now you’re
                  ready to start kneading.</p>
                <p>Simply place the dough on a flat work surface, then stretch it away from you, using the heel of one
                  hand to pull the other half of the dough towards you (both hands should move simultaneously to stretch
                  out the dough). Then lift the edges over and back to the middle. Give it a quarter turn and repeat the
                  process. It soon becomes a rather rhythmic operation, and the dough will then start to become very
                  elastic. What happens here is you begin to feel the magic – the dough literally begins to spring to
                  life, as you push it away and it defiantly springs back to challenge you. When it has become very
                  smooth, springy and begins to appear blistered on the surface (which takes about 3 minutes), it’s then
                  ready to rise. Alternatively, you can bring all the ingredients together in a food processor with a
                  dough hook and knead the dough for 3 minutes on a low speed.</p>
                <p>Place the dough in a clean bowl and cover it with a lightly oiled piece of cling film. The mixture
                  (which started out as a heavy lump of dough), if given the correct amount of time, will stretch and
                  expand to twice its original volume. This process can be sped up if the dough is placed in a warm
                  location, but the longer you leave it to rise naturally at room temperature, the better the bread will
                  be. It will also rise in cold temperatures, so if it’s more convenient, pop the bread in the lowest
                  section of the fridge and let it rise overnight, ready to bake in the morning. Dough when risen
                  properly, should have doubled in size and should spring back, feeling slightly sticky when lightly
                  touched with a finger.</p>
                <p>Once the dough has risen, it needs to be knocked down by simply punching all the air out of it with
                  your fist. Alternatively, if using a food processor; you can knead it again for 1 minute on a low
                  speed. Either way, the dough will be brought back to its original size, ready to rise for the second
                  time in greased tins. You will need two 450g loaf tins or one 900g tin. Again, once the dough is in
                  the tins, the dough needs to be covered, so place them inside a sealed, oiled polythene bag. This
                  second rising is known as ‘proving’ and as the name suggests, you’re actually testing (proving) that
                  the yeast is still alive and kicking. This ensures that the bread will have a more even texture than
                  if it were only proved once.</p>
                <p>Bake the loaves on the centre shelf of a preheated oven (230 degrees celsius) for 30-40 minutes or
                  35-45 minutes for the larger loaf. Turn them out, holding them in a cloth, then give the base of the
                  bread a sharp tap with your knuckles. If it’s cooked it will sound hollow and not dense. Remember it’s
                  always better to over bake rather than under bake bread. If you want an extra-crunchy crust; put the
                  loaf back in the oven without its tin for 5-10 minutes. This will crisp up the base and sides, so if
                  you do this, it will ensure that it’s cooked through.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>6-10 broccoli florets</li>
                  <li>Carrots (cut into thick sticks)</li>
                  <li>5 leaves of curly kale (cut into small pieces)</li>
                  <li>Green beans (chopped)</li>
                  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                  <li>Olive oil</li>
                  <li>Juice of 1/4 lemon</li>
                  <li>Toasted seeds to garnish</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Set your steamer (or a metal sieve sat in a pan with a lid that fits) to boiling, with an inch or so
                  of water in it. The lid should not be rattling, but a steady bubble should be boiling.</p>
                <p>Add the carrots and green beans first, letting them cook for a few mins, then add the broccoli and
                  kale.</p>
                <p>Let them all steam gently for a couple more mins. You can usually tell when they're ready by the way
                  they look- slightly brighter and deeper colored, and shiny. If they start to dull and are very soft,
                  this is a bit over done!</p>
                <p>Turn the heat off, and pour out the water from the steamer pan, then put the veggies back into it and
                  onto the fading heat, adding the oil, lemon juice, salt & pepper. Stir gently to coat the veggies with
                  the extras.</p>
                <p><i>Toasted seeds can be prepared beforehand: roast pumpkin, sunflower and/ or sesame seeds in a hot,
                    dry pan, and then take them off the heat when they're lightly browned. Let them cool slightly, then
                    add soya sauce and stir it in quickly to coat all the seeds. These are a seriously good snack alone,
                    or can jazz up many a dish, such as vegetables or salad.</i></p>

                <p>Wash the chards and cut them thinly. Remove the skin from the onion, cut in half and after

                <p>Before you turn the frittata, it’s a good idea to put it under the grill until the liquid on the
                  surface has solidified (do not put the handle of your pan under the flame but keep it outside). Using
                  a flat lid that fits right on top of the frittata go over the sink and turn it.</p>

                  <li>800g of chopped tomatoes</li>
                  <li>4 tablespoons of tomato puree</li>
                  <li>Sugar</li>
                  <li>A handful of fresh basil (roughly chopped)</li>
                  <li>Water or stock</li>
                  <li>Lemon juice</li>
                  <li>750g – 1kg of spaghetti</li>
                  <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
                  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Melt the butter in a large saucepan, then add the onion, garlic and rosemary. Cook gently for 5
                  minutes till soft and translucent. Add the carrot and celery, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
                <p>Put in the mince and brown it, while stirring continuously. Turn up the heat and add the tinned
                  tomatoes, tomato puree, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir. (Add water or stock if it becomes too
                  dry). Reduce the heat, partially cover your pan and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes minimum. Taste and
                  adjust the seasoning, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if you would like.</p>
                <p>Boil a large saucepan of salted water. Hold the spaghetti in the pan, lowering the heat as it
                  softens. Add a drizzle of oil to prevent it from sticking. Boil for 12-15 minutes, then pick out a
                  piece to check if it’s tender. Drain in a colander once cooked. Just before serving, add the basil to
                  the sauce.</p>
                <p>Serve in bowls with grated cheese on top, and potentially a salad as a side dish.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Heat a frying pan to medium heat, add a spoon of olive oil, and toss in the chopped parsnips. Fry for
                  around 10 minutes, turning gently occasionally. Once lightly browned, add the leek, then once that has
                  softened, add the garlic; letting it cook slightly. Finally, add the cumin, then the soy sauce.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, add the potatoes to a steamer. Check occasionally, and remove them once they’ve
                  softened. This should take around 10 minutes. Just before both sets of vegetables are ready, get the
                  soup pan ready; fill it halfway with water and add the stock, then heat it to a gentle simmer.</p>
                <p>Add all the vegetables, along with the herbs and spinach. Set on a very low heat and allow it to cook
                  slowly. Since the vegetables have been pre-cooked, the soup won’t need to simmer for more than 15
                  minutes. Add the spinach just before the pan is taken off the heat, to preserve the flavour and
                  nutrition; stir in the leaves and allow the pan to sit with the lid on for a couple of minutes.</p>
                <p>Serve piping hot with some bread or oatcakes.</p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Part boil the potatoes either by placing them in a pan of cold water and bringing it to the boil or
                  by submerging them in boiling water from the kettle and letting them stand for about a minute. Drain
                  thoroughly. Heat a splash of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan. When it’s medium-hot, add the
                  potatoes and gently fry them until they’re golden and soft.</p>
                <p>Chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces and add them to the pan. Continue to cook it for about a
                  minute. Beat the eggs in a bowl and add the milk, chopped herbs and some salt and pepper. Pour the egg
                  mixture into the pan and stir it all together with a wooden spoon. Continue to heat it gently until
                  the egg starts to cook, then turn off the heat. You can add chopped salami or chopped bacon if you
                  wish</p>
                <p>Spoon half of the mixture from the pan into an oven-proof dish. Sprinkle the raw spinach leaves into
                  the dish and then pour the rest of the mixture over the top of them. Sprinkle grated cheese on top if
                  you wish. Bake in the oven at 200 degrees celsius for 15 minutes. You’ll know when it’s cooked because
                  it will turn golden-brown on the top.</p>

                  <li>A handful of runner beans (cut into small pieces)</li>
                  <li>1 small/medium onion (chopped into small pieces)</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Remove the tips of the beans and the string that runs along the sides. Then wash them and cut them
                  into small pieces (1cm long) and keep them aside. Finally, wash the tomatoes and cut them into small
                  or big chunks, and keep them aside for later.</p>
                <p>Put the olive oil and chopped onions into a pot and let it stir fry on a low heat until the onion
                  becomes soft and transparent (remember to stir it from time to time, do not let it burn). Now add the
                  runner beans and stir fry on a medium heat for a couple of minutes, just to mix the flavours. Add the
                  tomatoes to the beans, mix well, season with salt, cover and allow to cook on a low heat for at least
                  25 minutes (or until the beans are ready). Remember to stir the sauce from time to time.</p>
                <p>Taste the sauce to check if it needs more seasoning and add the parsley. Mix it well with the other
                  ingredients and switch off the gas. When you need it, remember to warm it up before pouring it over
                  the pasta. Fill another pot with water, cover it with a lid and allow it to boil, (when the water is
                  boiling, lower the temperature when you slowly add the salt).</p>
                <p>Add the pasta of your choice and mix it well for at least a minute to avoid the pasta sticking to
                  itself. Then raise the temperature until the water starts boiling again. Now lower the gas to a point
                  where the water boils gently without overflowing and let it cook uncovered. Check the cooking time
                  given on the pack, taste your pasta and when it’s al dente, drain it in a colander, put it back in the
                  same cooking pot, pour the hot sauce over it and mix very well over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes.</p>

                  the flour.</p>

                  return to the heat and bring it slowly to boil. Add salt and black pepper to taste, and then add the
                  cheese. Continue stirring for a few seconds until it has been thoroughly blended.</p>
                <p>Add the cooked pasta, tossing lightly together, then spoon into the ovenproof dish, levelling the
                  surface. Add a little more grated cheese, and brown under the grill before serving.</p>

                <p>Wash all the vegetables first; peel the parsnip but leave the skin on the potatoes. Cut all the

                <p>Pour the olive oil, add the salt and pepper and sprinkle the mixed spices on top of the vegetables.
                  Mix them well until they’re all well coated and add more oil if needed. Place the pot in a very hot
                  oven (220 degrees celsius). Every 15-20 minutes, take the pot out and mix the vegetables well. (This
                  allows the vegetables to roast on all sides).</p>
                <p>When 30 minutes has passed, add the courgettes, red pepper, and smoked tofu (optional), cut into
                  cubes. Mix it well with the other vegetables and put it back in the oven to finish the cooking. When
                  they’re ready, remove the pot from the oven, and sprinkle some sesame seeds and tamari/soy sauce over
                  the top.</p>

                  <li>280g of spaghetti</li>
                  <li>3-4 tablespoons of pesto</li>
                  <li>3-4 cloves of garlic (chopped)</li>
                  <li>1/2 fresh chilli or a pinch of dry chilli (sliced into small pieces)</li>

                  <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Place a good amount of water in a pot to boil. In the meantime prepare the sauce. Pour a couple of
                  spoons of olive oil in a pan, add the chopped garlic and start frying it. After a minute, add the
                  chilli and the anchovies, fry on a low heat and mix the ingredients with a wooden spoon until the
                  garlic is golden. Then turn the heat off.</p>
                <p>When the water boils, add the spaghetti and some salt, remembering to mix the pasta in the water very
                  well, for a minute or longer to avoid the spaghetti sticking to each other. Keep stirrring the
                  spaghetti from time to time and taste after 7 minutes to check that it’s al dente.</p>
                <p>While the spaghetti is cooking, use a little bit of this hot water to dilute the pesto into a smooth,
                  creamy sauce. Drain the spaghetti, return it to the pan and add the olive oil and pesto sauce on a
                  medium heat for less than a minute to combine the different flavours.</p>
                <p>You can sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top to add extra flavour at the final step.</p>

                  <li>6-7 eggs</li>
                  <li>1 large onion or 2 medium onions</li>
                  <li>2-3 large chard leaves</li>

                  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Wash the chards and cut them thinly. Remove the skin from the onion, cut it in half and then chop it
                  thinly too. Break the eggs in a tall bowl and whisk well until the mixture starts foaming. Add some
                  salt and pepper, mix well and leave aside.</p>
                <p>Warm up a couple of spoons of olive oil in a frying pan, add the onions, and then stir-fry until they
                  start to soften. Add the chards to the onions and stir-fry for a few more minutes. Mix the eggs
                  quickly, and add to the vegetables. Leave to cook on a medium heat, until it is golden on the bottom.
                </p>
                <p>Before you turn the frittata, it’s a good idea to place it under the grill until the liquid on the
                  surface has solidified. Using a flat lid that fits right on top of the frittata, turn it over onto the
                  other side. Allow it to finish cooking on the new side over a medium flame like you did before.</p>

                <p>Boil the dry egg noodles until it starts to break up (Make sure the noodles are not too soft,
                  otherwise it will break up into small pieces when stirring in the sauce mix). Drain well, then place
                  the noodles back into the pan and leave it aside temporarily.</p>
                <p>Heat up a frying pan, and put in the vegetable/ olive oil. Then fry the chopped fennels for a minute
                  or two (a little drop of water in the pan will help keep the moisture in, whilst also speeding up the
                  cooking process). Finally add in the spring onions and turn off the heat.</p>
                <p>Place the cooked vegetables into the noodle pan. Stir in the sauces, mix evenly and serve.</p>
                <p>Put a table spoon of honey in it when it is still hot. You can also place it in the fridge, to have
                  as a cold snack.</p>

                  <li>1 pear</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius. Use a food processor to make a crumbly mixture of the almonds,
                  oats, linseeds, apricots and dates. Melt the coconut oil in a small pan at a very low heat. Pour the
                  oil in a bowl and mix the sugar and the vanilla essence.</p>
                <p>Wash and peel the pear, cut it into small pieces and put it into the same small pan you’ve used to
                  melt the coconut oil. Let it cook for 10 minutes (add a tiny bit of water or juice if necessary), and
                  let it cool slightly. Peel the bananas and mash them with a fork on a plate. Sprinkle a good amount of
                  cinnamon powder on top and mix well.</p>
                <p>Using a scale, place the processed mixture in it, and add the flour until you’ve reached
                  approximately 335g. Then add the baking powder and bicarbonate soda (you can add some more cinnamon
                  powder if you wish) and mix these dry ingredients well.</p>
                <p>Start adding a bit of the dry mixture to the coconut oil and sugar. Mix well and then add the bananas
                  and pears. Continue mixing, and then gradually add the flour mixture until it is finished. If by now
                  the dough appears too dry, you can add some soya milk (or any other type of milk that you prefer). Mix
                  well until you have obtained a softer dough.</p>
                <p>Pour the dough in a baking tin and bake for 40-50 minutes. If the cake looks cooked on the outside,
                  check with a toothpick to see if it is also done in the middle.</p>

                <p>Blend the tofu into a paste and gradually add the milk in small amounts until it becomes a smooth
                  cream. Similarly, blend the bananas with the cinnamon, vanilla essence and milk into a cream and then
                  combine this with the tofu. Whisk the coconut milk into the mixture thoroughly.</p>
                <p>In order to check if the amount of agar is ok; place a spoonful of the mixture in the freezer for a
                  few minutes and see if it sets. If it doesn’t, some more agar can be dissolved in some milk and mixed
                  with the original mixture until the right consistency is obtained.</p>
                <p>Pour the mixture into the cake tin and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Open the spring-form cake
                  tin and cut it into pieces. Drizzle lightly with date syrup before serving.</p>

                  the fridge for around 20 minutes. Mix the cream cheese and sugar in a bowl and then whisk in the
                  double cream. Pour in the lemon juice and zest and whisk until creamy.</p>
                <p>Make sure the biscuit base is properly chilled, then remove it from the fridge, pour the cream cheese
                  mixture on top and spread evenly. Put the cake in the fridge and chill for a couple of hours.</p>
                <p>Cut the strawberries into quarters and put them in a bowl with icing sugar and a drizzle of lime
                  juice. Remove the cake from tin and decorate it with strawberries and lime zest.</p>
                <p>Serve cold.</p>

                <p>Place the flour in a mixing bowl, then add the butter and rub it into the flour using your
                  fingertips. When it looks like breadcrumbs, add the sugar and stir together. Chop up the fruit of your
                  choice and place in a pan with raisins (optional), and 1 teaspoon of sugar and some spices. Add 2
                  tablespoons of water and simmer till soft.</p>

                <p>Peel the bananas and cut them into thick slices. Put a frying pan over a medium heat and add butter,
                  honey, cinnamon and a pinch of salt.</p>
                <p>Lay down the banana slices and fry for 4-5 minutes on each side (keep an eye on the heat and turn it
                  down if it browns too quickly). You want enough heat to caramelize and brown the slices, but you don’t
                  want to burn them.</p>
                <p>Once they’re cooked you can enjoy them as they are, or topped with toasted almond flakes/desiccated
                  coconut and a dollop of crème fraîche.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius. Lightly grease two round cake tins (6 or 7″ wide) and line
                  them with baking paper. Place chocolate squares in a cup in a saucepan, and fill the pan with a few
                  centimetres of water. Simmer until the chocolate melts.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, beat all the other main ingredients together in a large bowl (the mixture should be smooth
                  and thick). Fold the molten chocolate in. Dollop the mixture into both tins evenly and smooth the
                  surface with a knife from the centre outwards. Bake for 15-20 minutes in the oven. Remove it and then
                  let it cool on a rack.</p>
                <p>While the cake is baking, make the filling by beating the butter, icing sugar and chocolate powder
                  together until it forms a smooth paste. When the cake is cool, spread on both sponges. Dust the top
                  with icing sugar and grated chocolate.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees celsius. Grease a 500g loaf tin with butter and line the bottom with
                  buttered paper, dusted with a little flour.</p>
                <p>Sift the flour and baking powder together. Lightly beat the eggs with the sugar, secondly beat the
                  cream into the eggs for about a minute, and then add the lemon juice and zest. Fold in the flour until
                  it becomes lightly mixed and then gently fold in the butter.</p>
                <p>Pour the mixture into the tin and then bake for about 45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the
                  cake comes out clean. Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges and gently tap
                  the cake out onto a cloth-covered hand, and place it on a rack to cool.</p>
                <p>Add 2/3 of the lemon juice to the icing sugar to make the icing. Add the rest to thin as needed,
                  (even though it will get thinner after a few minutes, so be careful how much you add). Spoon the icing
                  over the top of the cake, allowing a little to dribble down the sides.</p>

                  <li>150ml of apple juice</li>
                  <li>A pinch of paprika</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius. Prepare the filling: place the ricotta in a bowl and crumble
                  in the gorgonzola, mix them well. Now add all the other ingredients apart from the pears and apple
                  juice, mix well and leave it aside for now.</p>
                <p>Cut the pears in halves, and remove the cores with a knife. Place the pears into a baking tray and
                  put the filling in the hollowed out pears. Pour the apple juice over the top and at the bottom of the
                  dish, cover with foil, and bake for 20 minutes or until the pears become tender. Remove the foil and
                  place the dish under the grill for a few minutes, till the filling gets a bit of colour.</p>
                <p>Serve immediately, on its own, or with a fresh salad.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>250g of porridge oats</li>
                  <li>Warm/hot water to bind</li>
                  <li>Olive oil</li>
                  <li>Enough sesame seeds to flavour</li>
                  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon of cumin/herbs</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Put the porridge oats in a mixer and blend quickly to further break down the oats. (It’s up to you if
                  you prefer fine or rough oatcakes). Set your oven to around half heat. Mix oats, salt, seeds, cumin
                  and/or herbs together in a bowl.</p>
                <p>Stir in the oil slowly, until it has been thoroughly mixed, then add hot water slowly, whilst mixing
                  to form a dough that possesses some elasticity and can be rolled. Roll out the dough on a floured
                  surface with a rolling pin.</p>
                <p>Cut out the oatcakes, using a smaller cup, and roll the mix out thinner if you want them to cook
                  quicker. Make sure your baking tray is oiled to avoid sticking. Cook for around 20-25 minutes; they
                  should be lightly browned on both sides, so may need to be flipped on their other side.</p>
                <p>Serve fresh out of the oven, with your favourite spread and home-made soup.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl. In a separate bowl or jug,
                  lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then whisk in the melted butter.</p>
                <p>Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter.
                  Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When it's melted, add a
                  ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time). It
                  will seem very thick but this is how it should be. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble,
                  then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm
                  thick.</p>
                <p>Repeat until all the batter is used up. You can keep the pancakes warm in a low oven, but they taste
                  best fresh out the pan.</p>

                  the cake out onto a cloth covered hand and place it on a rack to cool.</p>
                <p>Add 2/3 of the lemon juice to the icing sugar to make the icing. Add the rest to thin as needed but
                  it will get thinner after a few minutes so be careful how much you add. Spoon the icing over the top
                  of the cake allowing a little to dribble down the sides.</p>
